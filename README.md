SimpleWall is a backend platform that allows users to share photos, interact with content, and track activity.

## Key Features:
- User registration and post publishing with descriptions
- Editing and deleting own posts
- Viewing all posts
- Liking and unliking posts
- Displaying the number of likes and list of likers
- Commenting on posts and sending notifications to the frontend
- Editing and deleting own comments
- Viewing a specific comment or a list of comments for a post
- Retrieving a list of all user posts with a count of likes and comments

The project is based on a microservices architecture and does not include a frontend. It provides an HTTP API for data interaction.

## Project Structure
The application consists of 7 microservices, each serving a specific function:
